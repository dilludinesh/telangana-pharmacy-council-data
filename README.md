the latest numbers. Accepts an optional `--dataset` argument to target alternate
JSON files.

### `rxsync.py`
Daily-friendly synchronization utility that fetches the current council listing,
compares it against `rx.json`, and inserts any new or changed registrations.
Supports `--dry-run`, `--no-backup`, `--no-archive`, audit logging, and notification
stubs for Slack/email integrations.

### `README.md`

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Data Analysis
```python
import json

# Load the basic data
with open('rx.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

print(f"Total pharmacists: {len(data)}")
print(f"BPharm count: {len([p for p in data if p['category'] == 'BPharm'])}")
```

### Detailed Data Extraction
```bash
# Run the main extraction system (uses rx.json by default)
python3 reader.py

# Use a different dataset file
python3 reader.py --dataset custom.json

# Fetch only the latest total pharmacist count
python3 reader.py --total-only
```

### Makefile Shortcuts
```bash
# Display the current total count
make total

# Regenerate README statistics from the dataset
make update-readme

# Run the interactive data extraction workflow
make extract

# Fetch latest council listing and merge into rx.json
make sync
```
> Tip: Override the dataset on the fly with, for example,
> `DATASET=custom.json make total`.

#### Scheduling the sync
Add an entry to your cron configuration (or any job scheduler) to run the sync once
per day:

```
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/tgpc && make sync >> /path/to/tgpc/sync.log 2>&1
```

Adjust the schedule, repository path, and logging location to suit your environment.

You can also surface summaries in Slack/email by wiring a notifier into
`rxsync.py`'s `notify_changes` function.
